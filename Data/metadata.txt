VARIABLES from "baci_predation_data.txt" data file:

obs       - The row ids. Integer type, range of values from 1 to 4722.

site      - The acronyms of the seven sites used in the study.
            Character type: "AL", "ATT", "BR", "BS", "DR", "NB", "Pop9".
            The impact site considered in the study is "AL" (Abbotts Lagoon).

year      - The year when the data was collected.
            Integer type, range of values from 2005 to 2017.

period    - Indicates the moment before or after the considered impact (restoration occurred between 2010 and 2011).
            Character type: "After", "Before".

treatment - The type of treatment.

cl        - Number of clipped (consumed) racemes.
            Integer type, range of values from 0 to 92.

notab     - Number of not aborted racemes.

The data file "baci_predation_data.txt" was saved under "UTF-8" encoding, using "." as decimal separator and is a tab-delimited text file.

In particular, the "baci_predation_data.txt" file was derived from the raw field data (extra variables not used in the analysis were dropped) and saved with an R command similar to this:

write.table(x = raw_data,
            file = "./data/baci_predation_data.txt",
            quote = FALSE,
            sep = "\t",
            dec = ".",
            row.names = FALSE,
            fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
