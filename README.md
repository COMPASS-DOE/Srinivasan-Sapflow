# TEMPEST Sapflow Analysis

## Radha Srinivasan, Kendalynn Morris

This work examines five years of sapflow data from the large-scale manipulative TEMPEST (Terrestrial Ecological Manipulation to Probe the Effects of Storm Treatments) experiment. Sapflow data was examined for short-term and long-term differences across species and treatment groups and analyzed with a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) statistical model. Additional sensor data, including soil volumetric water content, soil electrical conductivity, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was also used in this analysis. 

The main branch of this repository contains fully reproducible versions of this analysis in two Rmarkdown files and several R scripts to create the dataframes used in these markdown files. Raw data is sourced from ESS DIVE at: doi:10.15485/2479200 (sapflow, soil water content, and soil electrical conductivity data) and doi:10.15485/2439400 (PAR data).
